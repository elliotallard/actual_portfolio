				As part of the course Computing for Good, a class taught in the Human Computer Interaction department, I worked in a team that developed a technological solution for the Pittsburgh community. Our clients, two CMU faculty, were starting a project, called the Night Owl Bakery.

				<br><br>
				The Night Owl Bakery is a community-oriented career center located in Garfield, a historically black neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Our clients noticed that much of the career development that has occurred in Pittsburgh (including technology, healthcare, the arts, etc.) has excluded some of those that call Garfield home, including those who are ex-foster care children. These folks have little to no support in finding career/financial advice, and often suffer great disadvantage and poverty.

				​<br><br>
				The Night Owl Bakery was created in order to empower these individuals. The center would host classes on career development (including food service, hospitality, healthcare), financial literacy, and sustainable food production. In the front of this center would be a bakery, in which people can purchase goods baked by "the bakers", or the individuals taking the career development classes.

				​<br><br>
				As a team, we were assigned to create an on-demand work application that would connect potential employers to the bakers through the transaction of baked goods. Essentially, a customer would order a batch of baked goods via the app, and a baker would then bake these goods. Then, the transaction between baker and customer would occur, in the hopes of creating a connection between baker and employer.

				​<br><br>
				We broke our process up into several design stages, including research, ideation, and iteration. These stages were then each repeated as the semester progressed, and as we gathered insights from our user base. Below is IBM's Design Thinking loop, a graphic that shows the iterative process we used throughout the semester.

				At first, we performed preliminary background research. We used sources provided by our client, as well as other material that we found relevant to understand the programming that exists for the impoverished/disadvantaged in the Pittsburgh area. We generated a list of insights from this research, as well as further questions we had about the problem.

				<br><br>
				Then, we used several design methods over various stages of the project, so I will break them up by method:

				<br><br><br>
				<b>Contextual Inquiry: </b>

				<br><br>
				In order to understand our user base, we performed a contextual inquiry at the Center of Life, an after-school program for high school students in the Braddock neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Our clients suggested some of these students could give us insight on the bakers at the Night Owl Bakery. From this research, we gathered that some folk feel alienated from the technology companies that are gentrifying neighborhoods such as East Liberty, but they were incredibly open to the idea of meeting strangers and forming lasting connections with them through the transaction of baked goods. In addition, we identified the baker's needs of safety (making sure other users have been vetted).

			<div class="col-7">
				<br> <br>

				In addition to this contextual inquiry, we performed two other interviews at the Bloomfield Garfield Corporation, a local organization active in college/employment preparation in the Bloomfield-Garfield area. We interviewed with several residents of the Garfield area, as well as program directors there. From this research, we were able to understand that our "bakers" were highly motivated when presented with monetary compensation, as many of them struggled to find steady employment. In addition, all of the people we interviewed were excited about the prospect of sharing their stories with others.

				<b>Think-Aloud Protocols </b>

				<br><br>
				For both times we performed this method, we created a protocol (consent script, tasks) as well as paper wireframes. In these, our goals were to get a sense of what the customer might need when they are interested in purchasing baked goods from the Night Owl Bakery. For our subjects, we chose random Carnegie Mellon students in common areas to participate, with the compensation of some cookies we had purchased. Specifically, we wanted to see how willing users were to talk to the "baker," as well as how to improve a possible interaction between the customer and baker. From these sessions, we learned that students who use apps such as Grubhub or Uber are sometimes uncomfortable with speaking with their service provider. We saw that the conversations that occurred between "customer" and "baker" proved to be awkward, and forced. From these sessions, we realized that we needed to pivot, and include as much as we could into the application to foster a social connection between baker and customer.

				We used several methods to generate ideas of how our application would be realized throughout the semester. I will list a few that follow somewhat of a storyline, and provide images of our work. This does not contain all of the methods we used, but it is a good sample of them.
				<br><br>
				Feature Generation

				This methodology was meant to further explore functionalities (which correlated to a specific need, motivation, or frustration our stakeholders experienced) our solution could support, with the hopes of selecting a couple to then iterate on and find form in our final deliverable. We generated ~20 of these, which allowed us to again create common understanding of the functionality of our application, as well as explore various design opportunities.

				In order to generate a navigation path through different screens that users might interact with, we used this method. By performing it, along with the use of our previous feature generation, we were able to outline the various screens that a user might interact with, solidifying the architecture of our application.

				Once we had our screen navigation and features in line, we began to rough-sketch screens that we would eventually want to develop. Our screen map allowed us to pick flows of screens that would be most useful in displaying and testing our solution. We used pencil and paper to do this iteration.

				<br>
				In this iteration of wireframing, we picked a font & color scheme for our screens, as well as many of the particulars that were left out in earlier iterations. In addition, we modified the content of our low fidelity wireframes to better fulfill the needs we perceived after using those previous wireframes in research. These wireframes allowed us the capability of better testing, as well as a shared visual realization of a solution which we could show to others, and have a conversation about.

				Amongst all of these methods, we used storyboarding to better visualize the processes that our solution would enable. These storyboards were used to talk to our client, explain to experiment subjects, show to members of the Bloomfield Garfield community, as well as circulate around our team in order to better understand the implications and results of our solution.

				<b>In Conclusion:</b>
				<br><br>
				Overall, the project was incredibly educational as well as impactful. I not only improved my cabilities in technology production, design, and teamworking, but also worked on something that could improve the lives of people who have experienced great disadvantage. As a team, we learned more about Pittsburgh and those who inhabit it, and more generally, that many of the great technological solutions of today leave behind many folks which the solution's creators did not account for. I, as well as many of my team members, hope to continue working on the project in the future.
