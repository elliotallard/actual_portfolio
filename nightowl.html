				As part of the course Computing for Good, a class taught in the Human Computer Interaction department, I worked in a team that developed a technological solution for the Pittsburgh community. Our clients, two CMU faculty, were starting a project, called the Night Owl Bakery.

				<br><br>
				The Night Owl Bakery is a community-oriented career center located in Garfield, a historically black neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Our clients noticed that much of the career development that has occurred in Pittsburgh (including technology, healthcare, the arts, etc.) has excluded some of those that call Garfield home, including those who are ex-foster care children. These folks have little to no support in finding career/financial advice, and often suffer great disadvantage and poverty.

				​<br><br>
				The Night Owl Bakery was created in order to empower these individuals. The center would host classes on career development (including food service, hospitality, healthcare), financial literacy, and sustainable food production. In the front of this center would be a bakery, in which people can purchase goods baked by "the bakers", or the individuals taking the career development classes.

				​<br><br>
				As a team, we were assigned to create an on-demand work application that would connect potential employers to the bakers through the transaction of baked goods. Essentially, a customer would order a batch of baked goods via the app, and a baker would then bake these goods. Then, the transaction between baker and customer would occur, in the hopes of creating a connection between baker and employer.

				​<br><br>
				We broke our process up into several design stages, including research, ideation, and iteration. These stages were then each repeated as the semester progressed, and as we gathered insights from our user base. Below is IBM's Design Thinking loop, a graphic that shows the iterative process we used throughout the semester.

				At first, we performed preliminary background research. We used sources provided by our client, as well as other material that we found relevant to understand the programming that exists for the impoverished/disadvantaged in the Pittsburgh area. We generated a list of insights from this research, as well as further questions we had about the problem.

				<br><br>
				Then, we used several design methods over various stages of the project, so I will break them up by method:

				<br><br><br>
				<b>Contextual Inquiry: </b>

				<br><br>
				In order to understand our user base, we performed a contextual inquiry at the Center of Life, an after-school program for high school students in the Braddock neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Our clients suggested some of these students could give us insight on the bakers at the Night Owl Bakery. From this research, we gathered that some individuals in Pittsburgh feel alienated from the technology companies that are gentrifying neighborhoods such as East Liberty, but they were incredibly open to the idea of meeting strangers and forming lasting connections with them through the transaction of baked goods. In addition, we identified the baker's needs of safety (making sure other users have been vetted).

			<div class="col-1"></div> <!-- for spacing -->
			<div class="col-7">
				<br><br>
				After we had defined our focus, we performed the following explorational research methods: contextual inquiry, affinity diagramming, diary study, think-aloud protocol, and speed-dating. I will only discuss the methods that I was involved in, but I am knowledgeable of the other methods that occurred on our team.

				<br><br><br>
				<b>Explorational Methods</b>
				<br><br>
				For our contextual inquiry, I interviewed a graduate student that regularly ran late to her morning class, which occurred at 9:30 AM. After creating an interview protocol, I performed the interview while taking the bus with her to this morning class. Some of the most important insights we gathered from this interview was that students who live off campus have a hard time finding a credible transportation apps that give accurate bus arrival times, and that being late can cause academic stress (especially when you are rushing to a test).

		<div class="row row-eq-height">
			<div class="col-1"></div> <!-- for spacing -->
			<div class="col-7">
				After the contextual inquiry, as a team, we created an affinity diagram to organize our insights from the two students we interviewed. First, we performed an interpretation session, in which we created two spreadsheets for each student, filled each with insights from the interview. Then, we embarked on the process of grouping insights together in order to see the bigger picture of how students choose transportation methods when they are in a rush.

				We then created a think-aloud protocol, with the purpose of finding how students use existing solutions (such as the apps Transit, Lyft) to get to campus when they are headed to class in the morning. After creating the protocol in our team and then performing the protocol with a different graduate student, I created a usability aspect report (UAR) to summarize the critical incidents that occurred over the study. From this UAR, we generally found that the current solutions of Transit and Lyft are not adequate in allowing students to plan ahead (these solutions don't promote time management), and that Transit does not provide the ability to customize which busses you see on the landing screen (which can be important when you are in a rush).

				After we performed explorational research methods, we then started creating design artifacts that reflected what we had learned from previous research. Because we were now making instead of just observing, we embarked in evaluative research methods that gave us feedback on how well we understood the problem based on the design artifacts we presented. Some of these methods include: speed-dating, "walking the wall," desirability study, 5-second test, and a think aloud protocol. In the midst of these, we were modifying our design artifact to reflect the research that was currently being done. I'll show the artifacts pre and post method, which will exemplify our thought process.

				<br><br>
				We started off with many components to our design artifact, but we narrowed down to two over the course of these research methods: a dashboard, and a set of customization screens. The dashboard would give the user a concise recommendation for transit, as well as help with time management, and the customization screens would allow users to personalize the recommendations our solution would provide.

				<br><br><br>
				<b>Evaluative Research Methods:</b>
				
				<br><br>
				In our desirability study, we wanted to find out the emotional responses that our customization section of our solution would evoke. Because it is essentially a survey, we wanted to understand if it was too many questions, too little, or something else we could modify. After doing this test on 5 individuals, we found that this design method wasn't exactly appropriate for our stage of research. We did get helpful design feedback, but users were not very emotionally affected by our artifact. The feedback that was helpful included clarifying confusing questions that we asked, as well as ridding redundancies.

				<br><br>
				After our desirability study, we performed a 5-second test, as well as a think-aloud (in which we iterated on our design artifact in between the tests).

				<br><br>
				For the 5-second test, we wanted to test the dashboard screen of our solution in particular, which would tell the user which transportation method to take, as well as how much time they had left to leave, among other things. After doing 10 tests, we received valuable, specific feedback, including that our dashboard confused users about when they had to leave (there was no "time you need to leave," there was only a countdown). We adjusted our screens, and then moved on to our next method.

				<i>Pre vs. Post 5 Second Test</i>

			<div class="col-1"></div> <!-- for spacing -->
			<div class="col-7">
				<br><br>
				In our final method, we created a short think-aloud protocol to find if users could understand how our customization screens worked, and if they understood how their answers to the questions we asked affected the dashboard they would see. With an interactive prototype, we tested 2 users, and created a UAR. From this UAR, we found that the navigation through these screens was confusing. After making changes according to this method, we were ready to submit!

				<b>In Conclusion:</b>
				<br><br>
				In this project, we selected and employed design methods that none of us had previous experience with. We all learned by doing, and failed more than a few times. But, after our failures, we learned from our mistakes, and solidified our understanding of the problem, and more generally, how we could best use the design method to gain insights about users in a specific problem stage or context. I also learned more as a teammate: how to communicate, how to give meaningful constructive criticism, and how to take it (the criticism). We ended up with something that our professors were proud of, as well as us. I can't wait to employ these mindsets and methods to my future studies, and continue a path of learning with it.
